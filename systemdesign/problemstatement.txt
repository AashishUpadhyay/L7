Create a basic system description and document a normalized schema from the attached widgets text file. 
Include 

1) what you think this system does 

2) what you feel would be a reasonable database structure for the data and a reasonable 
architecture for the system 

3) any questions or concerns you have regarding this dataset/system that might need to be answered before establishing an ideal database/solution for such a system.

- A database of different products ordered by customers and the prices, supplier, cost, warehouse location, available qty and min qty

- product (widget name, cost, available qty, min qty)
- widget type (Ant Trap, Mouse Trap ...)
- customers (Home Place, Bug Store etc)
- Orders (customer id, packaging information, price)
- warehouse (ATL, MSP, AUS...)
- suppliers

- Observations
    - Customers are priced differently for different orders, its not clear how. May be its date dependant. So we dont know the unit price for orderdetails
        -  bag of 10 Ant Traps costs 9$ to Home Place
        -  bag of 5 Ant Traps costs 5$ to Home Place
        -  bag of 10 Ant Traps costs 10$ to Bug Store
        -  bag of 5 Ant Traps costs 6$ to Bug Store
    - What does min_qty means?
    - Different suppliers may charge differently so we have inventory and inventory detail tables. Inventory detail table contains the cost price and if the order contains product from different inventory-details we charge differently
